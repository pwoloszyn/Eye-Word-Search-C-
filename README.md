# Eye-Word-Search-C-
This was a C++ software engineering project I made with a team of classmates. 
This is supposed to utilize a device that allows you to play this word search game with your eyes. 
For now for testing purposes we have replaces the eye functionality with the mouse.

To play hover your mouse over the option you would like to select (much like you would be starting over the option you would
like to select).

To select the words look at the letters in concatination with each other.

To add more words add a folder with the name of the category and three .txt files labeled "easy.txt" "medium.txt" "hard.txt".
